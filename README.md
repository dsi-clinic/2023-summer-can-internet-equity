This repository contains documentation about and links to datasets collected by Netrics Internet measurement devices which the [Internet Equity Initiative](https://internetequity.uchicago.edu/) research team at the [Data Science Institute](http://datascience.uchicago.edu/) deployed across Chicago starting in late 2021. Supporting resources to assist those that want to use the data are also available.

This repository is organized as follows:
- **[documentation](documentation)**: Find documentation about the data, the deployment of Netrics devices, and the pipeline that moves data from devices to a central data store.
- **[example-notebooks](example-notebooks)**: Find Jupyter notebooks with example code for working with the Netrics data and notebooks containing the analysis underlying some of the data stories on the portal.
- **[data](data)**: Find datasets used in some of the data stories featured on the portal.
- **[src](src)**: Find scripts used to pull data from InfluxDB.
